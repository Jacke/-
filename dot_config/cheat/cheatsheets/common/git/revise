# Git Revise

https://git-revise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

git revise is a git subcommand to efficiently update, split, and rearrange commits. 
It is heavily inspired by git rebase, however it tries to be more efficient and ergonomic 
for patch-stack oriented workflows.

* git revise -i <after-this-commit>
